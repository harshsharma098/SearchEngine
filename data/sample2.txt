Web Development and Modern Frameworks

Modern web development has evolved significantly with the introduction of powerful frameworks and libraries. React, Vue, and Angular are popular frontend frameworks that enable developers to build interactive user interfaces efficiently.

Backend development often involves Node.js, Python with Django or Flask, and various database systems. RESTful APIs and GraphQL provide ways to connect frontend and backend systems.

Responsive design ensures websites work well on different devices and screen sizes. Progressive web apps combine the best features of web and mobile applications.

Security is crucial in web development, with practices like HTTPS, input validation, and authentication mechanisms being essential for protecting user data.
