Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we interact with technology. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning uses neural networks to process complex patterns in large datasets.

Applications of AI include natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and recommendation systems. The field continues to evolve rapidly with new algorithms and techniques being developed regularly.

Companies across industries are investing heavily in AI research and development. Healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment sectors are seeing significant benefits from AI integration.
