Data Structures and Algorithms

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental to computer science. Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs are essential data structures that organize data efficiently.

Algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph traversal solve common computational problems. Time and space complexity analysis helps evaluate algorithm efficiency.

Binary search trees provide efficient searching and insertion operations. Hash tables offer constant-time average-case performance for lookups.

Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms are powerful problem-solving techniques. Understanding when to apply each approach is key to writing efficient code.
