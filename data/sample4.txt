Software Engineering Best Practices

Software engineering involves systematic approaches to designing, developing, and maintaining software systems. Version control systems like Git help manage code changes and collaboration.

Testing is essential for ensuring software quality. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests provide different levels of validation. Continuous integration and deployment automate the testing and release process.

Code reviews and pair programming improve code quality through collaboration. Documentation helps developers understand and maintain codebases effectively.

Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development and customer feedback. Scrum and Kanban are popular frameworks for managing software projects.
