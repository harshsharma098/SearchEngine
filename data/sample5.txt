Database Systems and SQL

Databases are crucial for storing and managing data in applications. Relational databases use SQL to query and manipulate structured data. Tables, rows, and columns organize information efficiently.

NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexibility and scalability for modern applications.

Indexing improves query performance by creating data structures that allow faster lookups. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity.

Database normalization reduces data redundancy and prevents anomalies. Understanding ACID properties helps design reliable database systems.
